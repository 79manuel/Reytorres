
Hello Gaelen,

The summer newsletter template is:
- Responsive and mobile friendly
- Safari, Chrome, Firefox and IE friendly

## Assets missing:
- I Could not find TiemposText font. I used TiemposHeadline-Regular instead.
- I could not find the Redstamp logo image at the very end of the template. I used the logo image from the very top instead.

## Issues:
-The only issue I found was the Bitmat image for mobile. I was not able to resize it to fill the space. (See screenshot below)
